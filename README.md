Analysis and create subset dataset on CICDDoS2019 csv dataset.

## Requirement
* Python3
* Pandas
* Matplotlib

## Usage
CSV-01-12 and CSV-03-11 is the folder put the data. It is empty because I don't put the dataset. It is too big.

* count_num folder put the code to count packet number.
* create_subset folder put the code to generate subset csv file.

## Introduction of repo
The dataset has two csv in different date. I use the code on count_num folder to count all the type of the packet. This is the result.
